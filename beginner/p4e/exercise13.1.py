# Change the socket program socket1.py to prompt the user for the URL so it can read any web page.
# You can use split('/') to break the URL into its component parts so you can extract the host name for
# the socket connect call. Add error checking using try and except to handle the condition where the user
# enters an improperly formatted or non-existent URL.
